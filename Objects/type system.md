# type system

- while python is a dynamically typed language it is still strongly typed.
    - what this means is, that once a variable is defined, we will not be able to change it's type again.
    - this is very much different from JS for example where vars can still be coerced into other types
    - this also implies that there is not type coercion in general & we will face type errors if we try to do so

- object references have no type attached to them
